Collecting data from sample ECG documents,plotting them into a graph* and then calculating the number of wave cycles in a single minute for any ECG signal through MATLAB which basically means the beat of the heart per minute. After finding the total number of cycles the next step is  finding the times of the first and last cycles, and divide the number of cycles by the difference between the first and last times. The rate units (beats/second, beats/minute, etc.) might be converted as necessary.. 


 
 *Some filter designing processes need to be done in order to get the information that we need efficiently.


Digital filters are central to almost every signal processing system. Filters eliminate unwanted artifacts from signals to enhance their quality and prepare them for further processing. Digital filters are used in a variety of signal processing tasks including outlier and noise removal, waveform shaping, signal smoothing, and signal recovery.
